    "The mechanisms governing hypothesis selection in deep learning are currently not fully understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to traditional machine learning, a large hypothesis class (e.g. corresponding to overparameterized models) can fit several datasets of increasing complexity, which practically leads to overfitting training data and noise within. However, in practice, deep networks are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, thereby learning generalizing solutions. At the same time, weakly regularized networks can fit arbitrary labellings of the dataset, showing that stochastic optimization, coupled with overparameterization, can in principle memorize a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "A paramount question is thus what factors govern learning vs memorization, and why large, overparameterized networks don't simply memorize the training dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we are going to explore established phenomena that set deep networks aside from traditional machine learning, so that you familiarize yourself with some fundamental open questions in deep learning."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In part I, we explore hypothesis selection in deep learning for image classification, by contrasting \"learning\" and \"memorization\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, we examine the empirical behaviour of deep networks trained to perfectly fit noisy labels, as a way to force the model to represent complex decision boundaries. Further, we empirically demonstrate that large networks are capable of completely overfitting a dataset [Zhang et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530).\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, corrupting every training label disrupts the semantic relationship between input images and classes, forcing the network to learn decision boundaries tailored to each individual training sample. This will constitute our operative definition of high-complexity classifier *memorizing* the training set. Changing the ratio of noisy labels allows us to control complexity of our trained statistical model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the assignment, we are going to implement the basic building blocks for our experiments, by reproducing the main result of [Zhang et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Your tasks for this part of the assignment include:\n",
    "1. Corrupting labels of the CIFAR-10 training set.\n",
    "2. Training a small ResNet to fit corrupted labels.\n",
    "3. Discuss the effect of explicit regularization on memorization.\n",
    "4. Discuss implicit regularization in deep learning."

    "If unregularized networks can fit arbitrary labellings of the data, what factors control the learning of patterns that generalize to unseen data? Is the success of deep learning simply explained by the right choice of explicit regularization?\n",
    "\n",
    "The following plot shows the effectiveness of several regularization techniques at contrasting memorization, by comparing the training accuracy reached under several degrees of label noise. Furthermore, for each combination of regularization techniques, the best validation accuracy on clean labels is reported in the legend of the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Comparison of several explict regularization techniques](figs/expl_regularization.png \"Explicit regularization vs label noise\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Which technique is most effective at hindering memorization?** I think the technique with decaying training accuracy as the label noise increases and reaches to 1.0 is the most effective at hindering memorization and which had the highest validation accuracy on clean labels data, i.e., the technique combined with Data Augmentation and weight decay of 1e-4.  \n",
    "* **Which technique yields the best performance when no corrupted training labels are present?** - All of them yield the same performance of near 100 percent when label noise was 0.0. But, with the clean labels data, the technique combined with Data Augmentation and weight decay of 1e-4 achieves the best performance of 91.7% validation accuracy.\n",
    "* **Is learning only possible with explicit regularization? Motivate!** - No, Learning is definitely beneficial with explicit regularization techniques. With no regularization, the model achieves near 100 percent training accuracy on various ratios of label noise equally but only 80.7% validation accuracy on clean labels data, which indicates that it fails to generalize and there was definite memorization involved. With explicit regularization, we were able to reduce the training accuracy gradually with noisy labels training. We were also able to achieve higher validation accuracy on clean labels for each case of explicit regularization, which indicates that it guides the model toward learning meaningful patterns instead of memorizing noise. So, deep networks can fit anything, but regularization ensures they learn useful structure rather than noise."

    "* **What do you observe? Is explicit regulaziation needed for achieving non-trivial performance?** Yes, explicit regularization is needed to achieve non-trivial performance. The model with no regularization technique was able to achieve the target training cross-entropy loss of 0.19 in only 12500 steps, but, it was only able to reach a trivial training accuracy of 80%. With explicit regularization, we were able to achieve 90%, specifically involving data augmentation. But, even the unregularized model generalizes well despite being capable of memorizing data. This suggests that something about the training dynamics or model structure implicitly regularizes learning — guiding the model toward simple, generalizable solutions even without explicit penalties like weight decay or augmentation.\n",
    "* **If explict regularization alone does not explain learning, could you speculate on what factors, implicit in standard deep learning, are responsible for generalization?** Even though explicit methods help, they don’t tell the full story. Deep networks still generalize better than expected even with minimal regularization, suggesting additional implicit factors at play:\n",
    "    - Network architecture priors: Convolutional networks are designed to look for patterns that repeat, hence they naturally focus on useful, general features instead of memorizing random details — even without extra regularization.\n",
    "    - Optimization bias: SGD naturally prefers flatter minima in the loss landscape, which correspond to simpler, more generalizable solutions rather than overfitted ones."

    "The code provided in this notebook is slightly more general than what is required to solve the assignment. In fact, you can use the code to train your networks on clean labels, for instance by also enabling data augmentation and batch normalization. If you choose to do so, you probably need to tweak the learning rate schedule as well. Below, one example of a piece-wise constant learning rate policy, often used in practice, is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the schedule proposed to train a VGG-11 network, on clean labels (`label_noise = 0.`), with data augmentation. For such network, it is suggested to use a small weight decay, like $1\\rm{e}-4$ and start with a smaller initial learning rate `lr = 0.01`. Such network will be needed for completing the optional task of Part II."
