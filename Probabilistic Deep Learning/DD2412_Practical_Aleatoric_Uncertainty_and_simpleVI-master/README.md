# DD2412_Practical_Aleatoric_Uncertainty_and_simpleVI

In this practical we review principles of modelling uncertainty and then implement a simple deep network on a toy regression task that can learn to estimate predictive uncertainty of both aleatoric and epistemic kinds. The epistemic uncertainty is modelled using variational approximation with simple posterior assumptions on network weights.
