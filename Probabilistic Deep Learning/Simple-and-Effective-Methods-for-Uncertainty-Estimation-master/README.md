# Simple-and-Effective-Methods-for-Uncertainty-Estimation


In this practical, we study two simple yet effective ensembling methods for uncertainty estimation. In the first practical, we have a look at the state-of-the-art Deep Ensembles method. In the second part, we have a look at a follow-up paper that tries to address some of its limitations.
